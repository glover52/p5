This is my version of 'TicTacToe', otherwise known as Naughts and Crosses, coded entirely out of Java p5. Each game starts off with the losing player going first (Player 1 for first game) and can be scaled down or up depending on how much space you want.

What can you do:
--------------
	- Play against another player
	- Change the size of the window (must be the same value x,y)

What I hope to add in the future:
--------------
	- Color choosing choosing for each player (Red, Green, Blue)
	- Versus AI option
