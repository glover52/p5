'Raindrops' creates multiple drops of rain that fall down with a gravitational value, as each drop falls, it gains velocity and thus, increasing the size of its tail.

You are able to modify:
--------------
	-	Gravitational pull on each drop.
	-	The scale of each drop
	-	Quantity of drops being created

Each drop resets to a random y value above (but still within the domain) the screen and also has its velocity set to zero so that it maintains the illusion of rain.

What I hope to add in the future:
--------------
	-	Color to each drop based on its velocity
		(blue = slow, red = fast)
	-	Interactive menu to play with the drops
		-	Drop elasticity
		-	Draw lines to create some sort of water flow
	-	General code modifications to allow more drops on a low end computer
