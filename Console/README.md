'Console' is a very simple text creator, it was only a test to see if I could add and remove text on the screen at any time. The name is a reference to the Windows Command Line black & white text and does not act as an actual console for any operating system. I repeat...

!!! IT IS NOT ATTACHED TO ANY CONSOLE !!! 
!!! THERE ARE NO RISKS WHEN RUNNING THIS !!!

You are able to:
	-Create and Delete text

As this was a simple test, I do not plan to add anything in the future, however it shall remain on github for anyone to use or refer to if they would like to create something similar.
